What is hovering?

Hovering is a meditation technique that I created in 2019 to help people suffering from mental illness and addiction.


What inspired the creation of hovering?

I run a porn addiction recovery website. In doing so I’ve become aware of many of the limitations of existing approaches towards mental health.

Especially for today’s generation of young people, as well as most adults I speak with as well.

For example, a lot of the teenagers I speak to really struggle not only to understand this idea of meditation, but to do something as simple as keep their minds still for a period of time. Not only because it’s a skill which they’ve yet to develop, but also because it’s not how they’re being brought up in regards to their day-to-day.

For example, a lot of suggested mental health practices like meditation are out of reach for a lot of people. Not only can it be a difficult to attempt something like meditation when you already have existing mental health issues, however a lot of the people I deal with are children or teenagers who have no idea about meditation at all.

The other issue is that although meditation (in my opinion) is the most effective way to treat mental illness and addiction, it’s also seen as something inherently spiritual or uncool (perhaps in part because it’s a foreign idea).


In a way, what hovering aims to do is teach us to respect technology

How does it work?

Essentially it involves leaving your mouse cursor within a stationary space for a period of time, all while leaving your hand attached to your mouse in a stationary position.

It can also work with a touch screen as well, except instead of using a mouse cursor you instead use your finger of thumb to retain that connection.

It’s absolutely vital that your hand is connected in some way, it’s a large part of what makes the exercise effective.


Why is hovering effective?

The fact is that technology is a simple fact of life.

Hovering is effective for a number of reasons, and I will try and address it within the context of why I came up with it in the first place.
